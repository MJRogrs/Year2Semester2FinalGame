What is our game about?
Our game is an open world walking simulator. 
You play as a cat who has been lost by your owner on one of their journeys through the forest. 
In being lost, you have bumped your head, thereby causing you to have short term memory loss. 
Now, it is your goal to find your way through the forest, searching for clues and items in order to gain your memories of your owner back and to find your way back home. 

In this prototype, you are standing outside the door of your owner’s house (Which is the location of the end of the game). 
The house looks familiar but you’re still not sure if it is yours, so you enter, walking around and inspecting items that look familiar to you. 
As you walk through the house, the bathroom should be the first thing you see with an object placed by the door (can be picked up and inspected), then the kitchen island with its cupboards. 
There are two feeding bowls next to the counter with a ball next to the bowls (all three objects can be picked up and inspected. 
The ball is the only object that can be broken). 
A sleeping mat is opposite the counter with some objects on top of the mat (these objects can be picked up and inspected except for the squashed cylinder and the squashed cone). 
Further in front of you should be a fireplace framed with two towering shelves, a small dining room table with a chair and a singular lounge chair with some objects scattered in front of it (all these objects can be picked up and inspected). 
You should also be able to walk right up against the chair and press C in order to climb it. The game is supposed to end once you reach the objects and look up to see your own sitting in the lounge chair (Obviously, this is not implemented in this prototype but this is what we wish for the end of our game to be).
